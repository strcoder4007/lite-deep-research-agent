Okay, let's tackle this query about the new Toyota GR GT. The user wants to know the expected price, release date, and specs. I need to go through the provided facts and memory notes to extract the relevant information.

First, looking at the extracted facts. There's a mention of a hybridized 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 engine with 641 horsepower. That's from the First Look article. But the release date and price aren't specified there. Then, AutoGuide.com says the 2027 model is expected in early 2027, priced between $45k and $50k, with a 2.5L inline-four and 300 hp. Wait, that seems conflicting with the other source. The Toyota GAZOO Racing premiere mentions the GR GT as a road-legal race car with a 4.0L V8, but no price or date. Another source from the same premiere says the GR GT and GT3 were premiered in December 2025, but no price or release date. The memory notes also mention the 4.0L V8 hybrid with 641 hp, but again, no price or date. 

Wait, there's a conflict here. The AutoGuide.com source mentions a 2.5L inline-four and 300 hp for the 2027 model, while the First Look and Toyota GAZOO Racing sources talk about a 4.0L V8 with 641 hp. That's a big difference. Which one is correct? The user might be confused. I need to check the sources again. The First Look article from Motortrend and the Toyota GAZOO Racing premiere both mention the 4.0L V8 hybrid. The AutoGuide.com source might be referring to a different model or a lower-spec version. Also, the release date in AutoGuide is 2027, but the premiere was in December 2025. So maybe the 2027 date is for the production release, while the premiere was in 2025. 

So, the specs: the 4.0L V8 hybrid with 641 hp is the main spec, but the AutoGuide mentions a 2.5L inline-four. That's conflicting. Maybe the 2.5L is for a different variant or a lower trim. The user might need to know both possibilities, but since the sources are conflicting, I should note that. 

The release date: the premiere was in December 2025, but the production release is expected in early 2027 according to AutoGuide. So the release date is 2027. The price from AutoGuide is $45k-$50k, but the other sources don't mention a price. 

Putting it all together, the specs include the 4.0L V8 hybrid with 641 hp, but there's a conflicting 2.5L inline-four mention. The release date is 2027, and the price is between $45k and $50k. Need to present both possibilities but clarify the conflict.

**Analysis**  
The GR GT’s specifications are inconsistent across sources. Toyota’s 2025 premiere highlights a 4.0L V-8 hybrid with 641 hp, emphasizing motorsport heritage and performance [Source 1]. AutoGuide.com, however, references a 2.5L inline-four variant with 300 hp and a 2027 release date [Source 2]. This discrepancy may reflect differing models (e.g., base vs. top-tier trims) or outdated information. The 2025 premiere confirms the car’s existence but lacks pricing details, while AutoGuide.com’s 2027 timeline aligns with production readiness.

**Conclusion**  
The Toyota GR GT is a high-performance hybrid supercar with a 4.0L V-8 engine and 641 hp, set for a 2027 release. While a $45,000–$50,000 price range is speculated, official pricing remains unconfirmed. Conflicting spec details suggest the need for further clarification from Toyota.

**Notes**  
- Sources conflict on engine type (V-8 vs. 2.5L inline-four) and power output.  
- The 2025 premiere confirms the car’s existence but lacks pricing.  
- AutoGuide.com’s 2027 timeline may refer to production, not the 2025 debut.
