**Executive Summary**  
As of 2024, global deployment of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) is in early stages, with limited operational projects and ongoing development efforts. Key regions include the United States, Canada, and several Asian and European countries. While SMRs are seen as a potential solution to meet rising energy demands, including those from AI data centers, regulatory, financial, and fuel constraints continue to hinder widespread adoption. China has made progress with factory-built SMRs, while the U.S. and other countries are exploring SMRs for clean energy and digital infrastructure needs. The market for SMRs is projected to grow significantly by 2033, driven by technological advancements and increasing demand for clean energy.

**Numbered Findings**  
1. Global SMR deployment in 2024 is still in early stages, with limited commercial operations [Source 3].  
2. China has made progress with factory-built SMRs, while the U.S. and other countries are exploring SMRs for clean energy and digital infrastructure needs [Source 3].  
3. The global SMR market is projected to reach $22.4 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 9.88% from 2026 to 2033 [Source 6].  
4. The ADVANCE Act, included in the newly signed Fire Grants and Safety Act, aims to boost nuclear reactor deployment in the U.S. [Source 7].  
5. SMRs are expected to see significant deployment in the next 6-7 years, driven by the energy demands of AI data centers [Source 2].  
6. The IAEA report highlights ongoing global SMR deployments and continued interest in SMR technology across multiple countries [Source 4].  
7. Regulatory, financial, and fuel constraints continue to hinder widespread SMR adoption [Source 3].  

**Analysis**  
The deployment of SMRs is being driven by the need for clean, reliable, and scalable energy solutions to meet the rising demands of digital infrastructure, including AI data centers. While the U.S., Canada, and China are leading in SMR development, global adoption remains limited due to regulatory, financial, and fuel-related challenges. The projected growth of the SMR market by 2033 indicates increasing confidence in the technology, supported by technological advancements and policy initiatives such as the ADVANCE Act. However, the pace of commercial deployment is still constrained by legacy issues in nuclear energy and the need for standardized regulatory frameworks.

**Conclusion**  
As of 2024, SMRs are in early deployment stages globally, with limited commercial operations and ongoing development efforts. While the technology is gaining traction, particularly in the U.S., Canada, and China, widespread adoption is still hindered by regulatory, financial, and fuel constraints. The projected market growth by 2033 suggests a positive outlook for SMRs, especially as they are seen as a viable solution for meeting the energy demands of the digital era.
